# Learning Applied AI

A short series on connecting to AI models with real code.

No theory. No "AI magic".

## What this covers

- How to call an API
- How models actually behave
- What settings matter (and when they don't)

## For beginners

- Python examples
- Minimal code
- Why things like temperature sometimes exist — and sometimes don't
- How newer models rely more on context than tuning knobs

## Models we'll compare

- GPT
- Claude
- DeepSeek
- Other models with different trade-offs
